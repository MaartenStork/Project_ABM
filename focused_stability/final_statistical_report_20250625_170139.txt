COMPREHENSIVE STATISTICAL STABILITY ANALYSIS - FINAL REPORT
======================================================================

Analysis completed: 2025-06-25 18:02:07
Total simulations: 2250
Statistical significance level: p < 0.01

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
--------------------
Parameters with statistically significant boundaries: 0/5
Significant parameters: 

DETAILED FINDINGS:
--------------------

SCALE:
  ✗ NO CLEAR BOUNDARY DETECTED
  Parameter may not have strong effect on stability

IMITATION PERIOD:
  ✗ NO CLEAR BOUNDARY DETECTED
  Parameter may not have strong effect on stability

COOPERATION INCREASE:
  ✗ NO CLEAR BOUNDARY DETECTED
  Parameter may not have strong effect on stability

Q:
  ✗ NO CLEAR BOUNDARY DETECTED
  Parameter may not have strong effect on stability

TRUST DECREASE:
  ✗ NO CLEAR BOUNDARY DETECTED
  Parameter may not have strong effect on stability

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------------

Based on statistically rigorous analysis:

scale = 5.903  # Best observed (no clear boundary)
imitation_period = 26.000  # Best observed (no clear boundary)
cooperation_increase = 0.777  # Best observed (no clear boundary)
q = 1.039  # Best observed (no clear boundary)
trust_decrease = 0.716  # Best observed (no clear boundary)

These recommendations are based on 2250 simulations with 15 repetitions per parameter value.
